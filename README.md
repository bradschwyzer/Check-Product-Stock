# Check-Product-Stock
Check new updated sites for Istock now.
As of right now this only works on istocknow.com and has several limitaions. This should work for any of the istocknow product pages that has a box in the middle screen that adds new locations with refreshes.

Limitations:

There is no data stored to prevent duplicates in the next email update. 
It doesn't account for in stock vs out of stock notifications. More work with beautiful soup will have to be done to do that.
Last store may be cut off due to 160 character text message limit. Need to split at 160 characters.
